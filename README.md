# CSC 780 Final Project

We are creating an application which will make use of NEWS API to give user the latest news/articles on Mental Health. Going one step further we will also include the user's ability to create new posts to show other users how they improved their mental health.


# Functions

- User registration page for new users. This will make use of standard registration page or OAuth 2.0 from different social media platforms.
- User Login page for already registered users.
- New Headline Display - This page will contain cards of different headlines with a small description. These cards will be clickable and that will navigate us to the whole article.
- New Detail Page - This page will contain the whole article of the navigated headline.
- Post Creation page -  This page will contain the tools to create a new post for registered users and the ability to post them.

## Dependencies

- OAuth from different platforms for registration.
- Firebase to maintain user data and login data.
- NEWS API to get articles related to mental health.
